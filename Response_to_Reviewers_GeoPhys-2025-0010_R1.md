**Comment 4**

*“Please, consider incorporating keywords like:*

*- Tilt Derivative*
*- Total Horizontal Gradient*
*- gravity database”*

**Response:**

We thank the Reviewer for the helpful suggestion. The keyword **“Gravity database”** was incorporated, as it directly reflects one of the main data components of the study. The other suggested terms, “Tilt Derivative” and “Total Horizontal Gradient,” are addressed within the methodology and results sections; however, we opted not to include them as keywords in order to maintain a focused set of keywords that emphasize the primary scope of the manuscript, which is the integration of gravity fields and the updated regional gravity mapping.

**Comment 6**
*“Total Horizontal Derivative (THDR)*
*Total Horizontal Gradient (THG)*

*Could you please ensure consistent usage of these terms throughout the manuscript?”*

**Response:**
Thank you for the observation. The terminology was standardized throughout the manuscript. The term **“Total Horizontal Derivative (THDR)”** is now used consistently, and previous occurrences of “Total Horizontal Gradient (THDR)” were revised to avoid ambiguity and maintain uniformity in the description of the applied filtering technique.

---

**Comment 7**
*“Tilt Derivative (TDR)*
*Signal Tilt (TDR)*

*Could you please ensure consistent usage of these terms throughout the manuscript?”*

**Response:**
Thank you for the comment. The terminology was standardized throughout the manuscript. The term **“Tilt Derivative (TDR)”** is now used consistently, and previous occurrences of “Signal Tilt” were revised to maintain clarity and terminological uniformity in the description of the applied filtering method.

*“We suggest including in both the text and the caption of Figure 3 that the quantitative contribution to the study, expressed as the number of data provided per institution, is shown in the figure.”*

**Response:**
Thank you for the suggestion. The manuscript was revised to explicitly state that Figure 3 presents the quantitative contribution of each institution, expressed as the number of gravity data points provided. This clarification was included both in the figure caption and in the corresponding paragraph of the text where the figure is described.

---

**Comment 15**
