# DATA INTEGRATION AND UPDATED GRAVIMETRIC MAP OF THE PARANÁ STATE

This repository contains the Python code and data used for the study published in the article "DATA INTEGRATION AND UPDATED GRAVIMETRIC MAP OF THE PARANÁ STATE". The study focuses on integrating various sets of gravity data to produce a unified gravimetric map of Paraná, Brazil, using open-source tools and libraries from the Fatiando a Terra project.

## Abstract
The state of Paraná, Brazil, was the subject of several geophysical studies, including numerous gravity data acquisitions. However, the existing data were not compiled into a single database. This project presents the integration of gravity data and a regional geophysical overview of Paraná's geological framework using Python and open-source libraries.
